## AI. (last revision : 14:10 19/06/2019)

note on files :
* server_connection.bat :
	* launches game's server (start `.jar`)
* javadoc.bat :
	* open the javadoc by launching the `index.html` file in the Javadoc folder.

## comments on code
the ai does not support all actions. Meaning that it does not know what to do with an constructor, or any ship that is not
an explorer. This needs to be fixed.
